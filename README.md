----

### Installation

* Download this extra from MODx manager
* Install modJWT
* After successfull installation: go to the default context in modx manager, find and edit sample page /modjwt/
* Then go to system settings > modjwt. There are some default configuration like: Secret Key, Private Key, and Public Key. 

Sample pages contain 1 HTML resource and 3 JSON pages. You can play around with it.

----

### Authorization Header

If you are having trouble validating the Token, try adding the following line to your .htaccess configuration.

    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
    
Some hosting stripped out "Authorization" header from http request.

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key
    openssl rsa -in jwtRS256.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwtRS256.key.pub
